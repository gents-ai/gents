# TLA+ Specs

Distributed-system verification for cross-node properties. Sibling to `../Proofs/` (per-node Lean specs) under issue #155's cross-boundary verification strategy.

See `../README.md` for how this fits the broader formal-verification model.

## Specs

- `ReversePairing` — control-plane convergence of subscription/replicator reverse-pairing between two peers. Spec design: `../../../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-reverse-pairing-tla-design.md`. Implementation plan: `../../../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-08-reverse-pairing-tla-spec.md`.
- `Sanity` — toolchain smoke test; not a real model.

## One-time setup

```bash
./scripts/install-tools.sh
```

Downloads `tla2tools.jar` into `.tools/` (gitignored). Requires Java 11+ on `PATH`. On macOS without a JDK, install via `brew install openjdk@17` and ensure `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin` is on `PATH`. Override version via `TLA_VERSION=v1.8.0`.

## Running

For Sanity (toolchain smoke test):
```bash
./scripts/run-tlc.sh Sanity
```

For ReversePairing (the real model):
```bash
./scripts/run-tlc.sh MCReversePairing
```

The script runs TLC with parallel workers and writes state-graph artifacts to `states/` (gitignored).

## Bounded parameters

Current parameters in `MCReversePairing.cfg`:

| Parameter | Value | Effect of increasing |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| `Node` | `{A, B}` | State space grows as |Node|^|Node|; 3-node run is feasible but much slower |
| `Collection` | `{c1}` | Liveness checking with 2 collections balloons the state space (depth 12+, >2M distinct states still growing after 10 min). Single collection is sufficient because per-(p,c) leads-to properties are independent |
| `RPCId` | `{r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6}` | More ids give more headroom above StateBound; raising without also raising StateBound has little effect; both together increase exploration depth |
| `MaxCrashes` | `2` | Each additional crash budget step multiplies the reachable crash-sequence count; +1 roughly doubles runtime |
| `NoOf` | `NoOf` (sentinel) | Not a tunable — must remain a value disjoint from RPCId |
| `StateBound` | `Cardinality(rpcIdsUsed) <= 4` | Bounds total RPCs ever issued in any trace; raising risks pool exhaustion before liveness converges (a bounded-model artifact, not a real bug) |

Larger parameters increase state space exponentially. State-space-exhaustion artifacts can mask real bugs; benchmark before raising.

## What TLC checks

Active lines from `MCReversePairing.cfg`:

- **`INVARIANT TypeOK`** — all seven state variables stay within their declared types throughout every reachable state.
- **`INVARIANT RPCIdsTracked`** — every RPC in `messages`, `inFlight`, or `pendingInbound` has its id recorded in `rpcIdsUsed`; prevents id reuse.
- **`INVARIANT RPCWellFormed`** — every Install/Teardown has `src # tgt` and `of = NoOf`; every Ack has `of \in rpcIdsUsed`; kind is always in the declared set.
- **`PROPERTY Convergence`** — every desired/replicator disagreement either converges (replicator catches up) or the operator retracts the desired entry; see Convergence form below.
- **`CONSTRAINT StateBound`** — not a checked property; truncates state-space exploration at `Cardinality(rpcIdsUsed) <= 4` to keep the bounded RPCId pool from exhausting before convergence completes.

Note: `InFlightJustified` is defined in `ReversePairing.tla` as a documented model property but is not enforced by TLC due to a bounded-model artifact (pool-exhausted states cannot be excluded without parameter changes that explode the state space). See its block comment in the .tla file.

## Fairness annotations

The spec uses two fairness flavors:
- **Weak fairness (WF)** on `Deliver`, `Process`, `ReceiveAck`, `Timeout`: action eventually fires if continuously enabled.
- **Strong fairness (SF)** per-node on `Reconcile`: action eventually fires if enabled infinitely often.

Notes:
- WF on `Timeout` is essential — without it, dropped RPCs strand `inFlight` permanently and Reconcile cannot re-emit (its `~PendingInstallFor` precondition stays false). The plan originally said "no fairness on Timeout" — that guidance was wrong; this README is the correct reference.
- SF (not WF) on `Reconcile` is required because `OperatorWrite` can transiently disable individual `(p, c)` reconcile preconditions, defeating WF's "continuously enabled" requirement. SF's "infinitely often enabled" matches a real periodic reconcile loop.
- No fairness on `Drop`, `Crash`, or `OperatorWrite` — those are voluntary actions that the model can skip.

## Convergence form

`InstallConverges` and `TeardownConverges` use a disjunctive leads-to form:

```
(c \in desired[n][p] /\ n # p) ~> (c \in replicator[p][n] \/ c \notin desired[n][p])
```

This says: every disagreement either converges OR the operator retracts. The strict form `P ~> Q` is provably violated by traces where the operator changes `desired` before `Reconcile` completes — which is allowed at any time in this model (`OperatorWrite` has no fairness). The disjunctive form is the standard "progress at every observed disagreement" pattern for systems with unconstrained operator input. The vacuity probe (Task 10 review) confirms it is non-trivial: TLC explores stable-`desired` traces and requires `Q` along them.

## Expected output

### Safety only (drop the PROPERTY line, keep INVARIANT lines)

```
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
... N states generated, M distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is K.
```

For default parameters: ~M in the high hundreds of thousands, runtime under 60 seconds.

### Full run with liveness (default)

Same final line, plus a "Checking temporal properties" phase. Total runtime: under 5 minutes at default parameters.

Last clean run: 322,560 distinct states, depth 19, 3min 21s, no errors.

A failure looks like:

```
Error: Temporal property Convergence was violated.
The behavior up to this violation:
  State 1 ... State 2 ... ...
```

Read the trace from top to bottom; identify the action between each state pair. Look for the divergence point — the state where progress stalled.

## Known limitations and follow-ups

- **Single-collection scope.** `Collection = {c1}` was needed to keep liveness verification tractable. The leads-to property is parametric in `(n, p, c)` and TLA+ symmetry means single-collection coverage carries the proof, but a multi-collection sanity run is worthwhile follow-up. **Follow-up:** add a CI run with `Collection = {c1, c2}` and a smaller `StateBound` to confirm cross-collection liveness empirically.
- **Per-action SF on Reconcile.** Current `\A n \in Node : SF_vars(Reconcile(n))` enforces fairness on each node's reconcile loop but treats the disjunction over `(p, c)` as one action. Multi-collection liveness may need per-(p, c) fairness: `\A n, p \in Node, c \in Collection : SF_vars(ReconcileInstall(n, p, c) \/ ReconcileTeardown(n, p, c))`. **Follow-up:** add when multi-collection runs are needed.
- **StateBound constraint.** `Cardinality(rpcIdsUsed) <= 4` bounds total RPCs ever issued in any trace. This avoids the bounded-pool artifact but limits exploration depth in long-running traces. **Follow-up:** lift the bound or replace with a different bound (e.g., per-cycle limits) once the model is stable.
- **InFlightJustified not TLC-checked.** The supporting invariant is defined as a documented model property but commented out in the .cfg because it fails in pool-exhausted states (a bounded-model artifact, not a real bug). **Follow-up:** TLAPS proof, or a parameter regime that avoids the artifact.
- **Provenance.** Not modeled here. The structural-safety invariants check actions are well-formed, but a full provenance proof — every replicator entry traces back to a prior `desired`-then-`Process` chain — is a future TLAPS effort.
- **Set semantics for `messages`.** Assumes RPC ids are unique (which the model enforces). Real network duplicates can be modeled via `Send` re-emitting under different ids.
- **N > 2 nodes, data-plane convergence, authorization correctness.** Explicit non-goals per the spec.

## Refining the model

If TLC finds a real bug:

1. Inspect the counterexample trace — which action transitions led to violation?
2. Decide: is the model wrong (over-permissive transition relation) or is the property over-stated?
3. Fix the model and re-run; never silently weaken the property to make a violation go away.
4. Document the diagnosis in the commit message.
